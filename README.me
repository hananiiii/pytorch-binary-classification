# PyTorch Binary Classification

The notebook walks through the full process of:

- Generating synthetic classification data
- Building a custom neural network with `torch.nn.Module`
- Training and evaluating the model
- Visualizing decision boundaries
- Understanding predictions vs labels
-trying diff methodes to increase the accurancy


To install dependencies:

```bash
pip install torch matplotlib scikit-learn
